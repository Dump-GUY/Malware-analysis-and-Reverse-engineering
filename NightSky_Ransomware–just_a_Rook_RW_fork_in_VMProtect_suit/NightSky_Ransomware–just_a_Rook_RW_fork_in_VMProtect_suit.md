# **NightSky Ransomware – just a Rook RW fork in VMProtect suit**

The main subject of this analysis is to explain Cryptographic functions used in
NightSky and Rook ransomwares and compare their similarities and differences.
This is not just some kind of show-off report but the main purpose of this, is
to share some knowledge, ideas, work-flow and problems which could occur during
this kind of research.

Before we jump in, both of these ransomwares are using the same version of
statically linked OpenSource library Mbed TLS (2.23.0 – 2.24.0) to implement
Crypto functions. Because of minor changes in Mbed TLS between versions 2.23.0
and 2.24.0 (ransomware code is not affected by these changes), there is no way
to specify which one of these version was used, but more important is that both
ransomwares are using the same version of Mbed TLS.

Finding out the exact version was a pitty work, involving compilation of
different version of Mbed TLS (last 20 versions) with exact same version of
Visual Studio (2015) and same version of compiler tools (19.00.24245 – obtained
from Rook RW). Because of shredded Rich Header in NightSky ransomware (caused by
used VMProtect), we can only presume that both of these RW were built with
compiler tools 19.00.????? probably Visual Studio 2015 but not necessary. In the
Rook case, we also know the exact version of compiler tools (19.00.24245) – Rich
Header presented.

Real hard work started with many attempts to find the correct C\\C++ compiler
and linker configuration which was used in both of these ransomwares (involving
reversing of Mbed TLS functions in ransomwares and produced .dll and .obj (in
.lib file) files). Fortunately, and not surprising, the best configuration was
the same for both of these ransomwares. Built .lib files served for generating
FLIRT signatures and .dll files with pdb symbols were used for fuzzy matching
with Rizzo signatures, fingermatch signatures, diaphora... Big differences
between matched functions, using different versions of Mbed TLS, let to exact
version of Mbed TLS (2.23.0 – 2.24.0) which was used in both cases. These facts
could be just an interesting coincidence but after I introduce the code
similarity it will be obvious that NightSky Ransomware is just a fork of Rook
and there is possibility that same TA is behind the creation of these
Ransomwares. (another possibility is leaked src code etc..).

## **Let´s do some reversing**

After this brief introduction we can jump to the main function of these
ransomwares. We can see main function of Rook and NighSky RW in the picture
below. NightSky omitted some functionality of Rook (processing cmdline
arguments, debug mode…) and some were just moved to different functions but code
similarity related to multi-threading and synchronization remains.

![](media/3b00de6998edaec41f72bf9a02fdcd77.png)

One of the first function in “main” in both of these ransomwares -
“setPRNG_generate_VictimRSAKeys_encryptVictimPrivateKEY” is responsible for
generating Victim RSA2048 key pair where Victim RSA2048 private KEY is encrypted
by TAs embedded RSA2048 public key. The encryption of victim RSA private key is
performed in loop of 200 bytes as you can see in the picture below. Again the
similarity of code is obvious.

We can move on to function which is start routine of newly spawned threads. This
NightSky routine is handled by literally copy-paste code from Rook RW and serves
as synchronization which leads to function responsible for file encryption
“encrypt_file”.

In “encrypt_file” function code below we can see that both of these ransomwares
are using Mbed TLS random module to generate for each file unique 16 bytes
random AES key. This AES key is later used but also gets encrypted by previously
generated victim RSA2048 public key and saved to structure which will be later
part of encrypted file footer.

Usage of the randomly generated AES key is different in NightSky and Rook
ransomware. Rook ransomware encryption is a combination of AES128 ECB mode with
intermitten encryption -\> looping 32 bytes chunks where only first 16 is
encrypted. Max encrypted size is 524288\*3.

NightSky ransomware encryption is AES128 CBC mode with hardcoded IV where max
encrypted size is the same as in Rook case - 524288\*3.

You can see NightSky AES128 CBC mode with hardcoded IV below.

Our final stage of analysis is comparing of encrypted file structure.

Rook Ransomware encrypted file structure (only something I named
Quadpart_presented tag is in addition to NightSky – this tag has no meaning and
because of that was probably omitted):

## **Conclusion:**

As we could see, the similarity between Rook and NightSky ransomware looks
sometimes like copy-paste of code.

What could be quite tricky thing for analysts is that NightSky is delivered as
VMProtected and with combination of statically linked Mbed TLS crypto library it
could be let´s say “unpleasant”.

Some functionality from Rook Ransomware (not part of crypto process) is not
presented in code of NightSky. Only one difference in encryption is that
NightSky RW replaced intermitten AES-ECB encryption for more secured AES-CBC.

## **Recommendation:**

If possible always try to perform decryption on your own (spoofing public key,
grabbing session keys, hooking etc…) to confirm your analytical assumptions.
